# `.dotfiles`

My shitty dotfiles. Currently supporting configs for:

- Git
- ZSH
- Vim (very basic config, no plugins)
- tmux (I love these bindings <3)

## Scripts

- `install.sh`: installs some packages (WIP, maybe not useful)
- `link.sh`: creates the required symlinks for config files. (better way to to
  this??)
