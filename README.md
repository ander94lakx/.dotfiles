# `.dotfiles`

My shitty dotfiles. Maybe they are a bunch of garbage, but are MY bunch of
garbage.

## Config files

- **Git**
- **ZSH** as my shell
- **Alacritty** as my terminal emulator
- **Vim** as my terminal based text editor, with very basic config and some plugins (plugins not uploaded)
- **tmux**, as my multiplexor , with my Alt + vim-arrows custom binding
- **Editorconfig** (I will try to mantain this, I promise)
- **i3** (and i3status) with with Super + vim-arrows ("jkl;" ... really i3??)
- **Ranger** as my terminal based file manager
- **Dunst** as my notification system for i3
-
## Scripts

- `install.sh`: installs some packages (WIP, maybe not useful)
    - Distro "agnostic"
    - Harcoded list (I need to extract that)
- `link.sh`: creates the required symlinks for config files. 
    - (still thinking about the best way to do this)
